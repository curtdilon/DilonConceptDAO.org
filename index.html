            <h2>About Dilon Concept DAO</h2>
            <p>The Dilon Concept DAO is a revolutionary approach to societal restructuring based on resource rights and meritocratic governance. We aim to build a global ecosystem where virtual country replicas (DC [Country] Replicas) and the central Dilonland virtual world allow for the testing and implementation of these principles. This simplified website provides an overview of its key components and future vision, emphasizing our commitment to transparency, community, and sustainable development.</p>

                <li><strong>Legal Structure:</strong> Independent, non-profit international foundation.</li>
                <li><strong>Governance:</strong> Multi-layered model including a Foundation Council, Executive Director, R&D Advisory Committees, and a Transparency & Ethics Oversight Body.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Public financial reporting, R&D project database, open governance meetings (summaries), and public consultations.</li>

            <h2>Dilon Concept Gaming Environment</h2>
            <p>An integrated gaming environment is envisioned to support the Dilon Concept DAO. This environment will not just be for entertainment but will also serve as a platform for education, simulation, and community engagement related to Dilon principles. Key features and considerations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Education on Dilon principles (resource management, self-sufficiency), simulation of economic models, community building, and potentially sustainable economic activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Built on Polygon, leveraging NFTs for true asset ownership (in-game items, land). May utilize VR/AR for immersive experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>DAO Integration:</strong> Governance of the gaming environment could be managed by a sub-DAO or integrated into the main Dilon Concept DAO.</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue Models:</strong> Potential revenue from primary sales of foundational game assets (NFTs), secondary market fees, and custom gaming experiences for DC [Country] Replicas. A portion of net revenue could contribute to the Dilon Concept Foundation.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Emphasis on simulation, strategy, building, and educational games aligned with Dilon Concept ethos, rather than purely speculative Play-to-Earn models.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The gaming environment aims to make learning about and participating in the Dilon Concept engaging and interactive, fostering a vibrant community around these innovative ideas.</p>
