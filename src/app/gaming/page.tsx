        <p className="text-md sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Drawing inspiration from metaverse and blockchain gaming advancements, the Dilon Gaming Environment will incorporate several key features:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-md sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            <strong>Alignment with Dilon Principles:</strong> Games will be designed to reflect or allow exploration of resource management, self-sufficiency (e.g., building virtual Dilon Houses), meritocracy, and collaborative projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>NFT-Powered Asset Ownership:</strong> Players can truly own in-game assets (cosmetics, special tools, decorative items for virtual Dilon Houses) as NFTs, tradable on a dedicated marketplace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DAO-Integrated Governance:</strong> Aspects of the gaming environment, such as new game module proposals or economic parameter adjustments, could be influenced or governed by community input through the Dilon Concept DAO or a specialized gaming sub-DAO.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus on Simulation & Strategy:</strong> Emphasis will be on simulation, strategy, building, and educational games rather than purely speculative Play-to-Earn (P2E) models, ensuring alignment with the Dilon Conceptâ€™s constructive ethos.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cross-Platform Accessibility:</strong> Aim for accessibility across various devices, potentially starting with web-based experiences and exploring VR/AR integrations in the future.

        <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6 text-green-600">3. Potential Revenue Streams</h2>
        <p className="text-md sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          While the primary goal is engagement and education, the gaming environment can also generate sustainable revenue to support the Dilon Concept DAO and the Dilon Concept Foundation. Potential streams include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-md sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            <strong>Sale of Unique In-Game Assets (NFTs):</strong> Primary sales of cosmetic or utility-based gaming NFTs (non-essential for core Dilon access or governance participation).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketplace Fees:</strong> A small percentage fee on player-to-player trades of gaming NFTs within the official Dilon marketplace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Premium Experiences/Events:</strong> Fees for accessing specialized gaming experiences, tournaments, or exclusive content modules (optional for users).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User-Generated Content Sales:</strong> If the platform supports it, a share from sales of community-created game assets or experiences.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-md sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          A portion of net revenue generated will be allocated to the Dilon Concept Foundation to fund further R&D, creating a virtuous cycle.
